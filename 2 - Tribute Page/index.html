        Bruce Lee (1940-1973) was a Hong Kong-American martial artist, actor, director, and philosopher, widely regarded as one of the most influential martial artists of all time. He founded the martial art philosophy of Jeet Kune Do, emphasizing adaptability and practicality. Through films like <em>Enter the Dragon</em> and <em>The Way of the Dragon</em>, he broke cultural barriers and introduced martial arts cinema to a global audience.
